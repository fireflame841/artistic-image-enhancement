to run the code the following steps need to be followed:
you should use the given command line argumnet :
python part3.py ref_img.jpg grey_img.jpg

where ref_img denotes the path of the reference image, and grey_img denotes the path of the greyscale image to be colored
note: the greyscale image should be in rgb format so that it is a 3d array

the swatches are defined manually and can be adjusted in the code itself, we have used only 2 swatches for the sample result generation
